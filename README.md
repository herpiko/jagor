## Jentor

Jentor was originally an unsuccessful idea submission for <a href="https://www.cocreate.id/cocreation-week-2020/hackathon/">Jenius's CoCreation Week 2020 Hackathon</a>. See our proposal <a href="https://github.com/herpiko/jentor/blob/master/jentor.pdf">here</a>.

### Disclaimer

This is still a work-in-progress, may contains bugs, and only supports the English version of transaction history document. Also there is no guarantee that the parser will always work as expected. If Jenius decided to change the PDF layout or column of the report then Jentor may fail. The use or reliance of any information generated on this app is solely at your own risk.

Our app does not and will not upload the PDF file to the cloud. Your document will be parsed and processed in the app/browser itself, hence zero user data will be out from your device. We can not and will not try to obtain your data. We know and fully understand about privacy.
