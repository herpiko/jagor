## Jentor

Jentor was originally an unsuccessful idea submission for <a href="https://www.cocreate.id/cocreation-week-2020/hackathon/">Jenius's CoCreation Week 2020 Hackathon</a>. See our proposal <a href="https://github.com/herpiko/jentor/blob/master/jentor.pdf">here</a>.

This is still a work-in-progress and may contains bugs. Also there is no guarantee that the parser will always work as expected. If Jenius decided to change the PDF layout or column of the report then Jentor may fail.

### Privacy

Our app does not and will not upload the PDF file to the cloud. Your document will be parsed and processed in the app/browser itself, hence zero user data will be out from your device. We know and fully understand about privacy.
